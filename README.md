I'm an Argentinian developer, 21 years old, professional, dedicated and organized.
I really enjoy developing and I'm currently studying a career referred to that.
I've spent already 10 years developing (I started at 2011 with VB6.0) and keep on with other languages.
I love to automate tiring tasks and integrate different systems.
